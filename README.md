# VHDL Projects for the Papilio One Keyboard and Mouse (PS2) Wing

This repo contains multiple projects for accessing a keyboard and mouse over a PS2

* Keyboard Scan Code - Reads scan codes from a keyboard and emits them as ASCII to the USB serial interface. Note that this project uses UART code from Xilinx which is not included in this project. To download those files and for additional information see [PicoBlaze 8-bit Microcontroller](http://www.xilinx.com/products/ipcenter/picoblaze.htm)
* Mouse Reader - Reads the x/y counters and the 3 buttons from a mouse to control lights on two Button/LED wings
